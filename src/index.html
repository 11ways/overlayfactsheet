<h1>Overlay Fact Sheet</h1>
<h2>Introduction, Definition, and History of Web Accessibility Overlays</h2>
<p>Summary: Overlays are a broad term for technologies aimed at improving the accessibility of a website by applying third-party source code (typically JavaScript) to make improvements to the front-end code of the website.</p>

<!--//
  * full history of overlays beginning with browsealoud, readspeaker, etc.
  * description of things like userway, equalweb etc.
  * description of Amaze, Alchemy, and Sentinel

 //-->

<h2>Strengths and Weaknesses of Overlay &quot;Widgets&quot;</h2>
<p>Summary: Overlay widgets unnecessary and poorly placed in the technology stack.</p>

<!--//
  * features of the widgets
  * discussion of the utility provided
  * discussion of why a per-site assistive technology is impractical and, in essence, merely a "feel good" feature, because users who need AT already have it
 //-->


<h2>Strengths and Weaknesses of Automated Repair</h2>
<p>Summary: While some automated repair is possible, customers should be discouraged from using an overlay as a long-term solution.</p>

<!--//
  * discussions of the kinds of things that can be fixed and cannot be fixed
  * long-term reliance on an overlay's repair features is a bad strategy

 //-->


<h2>Fitness for Achieving Compliance with Accessibility Standards</h2>
<p>Summary: While the use of an overlay may improve compliance with a handful of provisions in major accessibility standards, full compliance cannot be achieved with an overlay.</p>

<!--//
  * full compliance is impossible
  * widgets are unable to bridget that gap

 //-->


<h2>Notable controversies</h2>
