<h1>Overlay Fact Sheet</h1>

<h2>Introduction, Definition, and History of Web Accessibility Overlays</h2>
<p class="summary">Summary: Overlays are a broad term for technologies aimed at improving the accessibility of a website
    by applying third-party source code (typically JavaScript) to make improvements to the front-end code of the
    website.</p>
<p>Website add-on products purporting to improve accessibility go back to the late 1990s with products like <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoya_Corporation#ReadSpeaker">Readspeaker</a> and <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BrowseAloud">Browsealoud</a>. Both of which added text-to-speech
    capabilities to the website(s) on which they were installed. Later, similar products came to market that added
    additional tools to their software that allow user-based control of things like font-sizes and changes to the web
    pages colors so that contrast is improved. Products like Userway, EqualWeb, AudioEye, User1st, and accessiBe. These
    products may also be white labelled under additional names.</p>

<h2>Strengths and Weaknesses of Overlay &quot;Widgets&quot;</h2>
<p class="summary">Summary: Overlay widgets unnecessary and poorly placed in the technology stack.</p>
<p>As stated above, some overlay products contain widgets which present a series of controls that modify the
    presentation of the page they're on. Depending on the product, those changes may do things like change the page
    contrast, enlarge the size of the page's text, or perform other changes to the page that are intended to improve the
    experience for users with disabilities. To laypersons, these features may seem beneficial, but their practical value
    is largely overstated because the end users that these features claim to serve will already have the necessary
    features on their computer, either as a built-in feature or as an additional piece of software that the user needs
    to access not only the Web but all software. On this latter point, it is a mistake to believe that the features
    provided by the overlay widget will be of much use by end users because if those features were <em>necessary</em> to
    use the website, they'd be needed for all websites that the user interacts with. Instead, the widget is - at best -
    redundant functionality with what the user already has. </p>

<h2>Strengths and Weaknesses of Automated Repair</h2>
<p class="summary">Summary: While some automated repair is possible, customers should be discouraged from using an
    overlay as a long-term solution.</p>
<p>Some overlay products have capabilities aimed at providing accessibility repairs to the underlying page on which the
    overlay is added. These repairs are applied when the page loads in the user's browser. While it is true that a
    non-trivial array of accessibility problems can be repaired in this manner, the nature, extent, and accuracy of such
    repair are limited by a number of important factors:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Automated application of text alternatives for images is not reliable</li>
    <li>Automated repair of field labels, error management, error handling, and focus control on forms is not reliable
    </li>
    <li>Automated repair of keyboard access is not reliable</li>
    <li>Modern, component-based user interfaces, such as those using ReactJS, Angular, or Vue may change the state of
        all or some of the underlying page independently of the overlay, rendering it unable to fix those
        JavaScript-driven changes to content.
    </li>
    <li>Repairs to the page can either slow down page load times or cause unexpected page changes for assistive
        technology users.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the above, overlays do not repair content in Flash, Java, Silverlight, PDF, HTML5 Canvas, SVG, or
    media files.</p>

<p>An additional class of product exists, which only perform automated repairs and are marketed as a temporary solution.
    These include Amaze by Deque Systems, Alchemy by Level Access, and Sentinel by Tenon. For purposes of this document, these products aren't
considered to be in the same class of product as the overlays that provide widgets.  The most notable difference, beyond the
lack of a &quot;widget&quot; is that Amaze, Alchemy, and Sentinel are understood by their manufacturers as being intended for use as an <em>interim</em> solution.</p>

<h2>Fitness for Achieving Compliance with Accessibility Standards</h2>
<p class="summary">Summary: While the use of an overlay may improve compliance with a handful of provisions in major
    accessibility standards, full compliance cannot be achieved with an overlay.</p>
<p>Among the many claims made by overlay vendors is the claim that the use of their product will being the site into
    compliance with accessibility standards such as WCAG 2.x, related and derivative standards, and laws that mandate
    compliance with those standards.</p>

<blockquote>
    Conformance to a standard means that you meet or satisfy the 'requirements' of the standard. In WCAG 2.0 the
    'requirements' are the Success Criteria. To conform to WCAG 2.0, you need to satisfy the Success Criteria, that is,
    there is no content which violates the Success Criteria.
    <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/conformance">Understanding WCAG 2.0: Understanding
        Conformance</a> </cite>
</blockquote>

<p>Given that conformance is defined as meeting <em>all</em> requirements of the standard, these products' documented inability to repair all
possible issues means that they cannot bring a website into compliance. Products marketed with such claims should be viewed with significant scepticism.</p>

<h2>In their own words</h2>
<p>Please note: while this section may mention specific vendors, these comments are par-for-the-course when it comes to the user experience provided by overlay widgets which have, in themselves, a pattern of negatively impacting the user experience</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p></p>


<h2>Statement from Sponsors and Signatories to this Fact Sheet</h2>
<p>As a result of the above information:</p>
<ol>
    <li>We will never advocate, recommend, integrate an overlay which deceptively markets itself as providing automated compliance with laws or standards</li>
    <li>We will always advocate for the remediation of accessibility issues at the source of the original error</li>
    <li>We will refuse to stay silent when overlay vendors use deception to market their products</li>
    <li>More specifically, we hereby advocate for the removal of accessiBe, AudioEye, UserWay, User1st, MK-Sense, and all similar products and encourage the site owners who've implemented these products to use more robust, independent, and permanent strategies to making their sites more accessible</li>
</ol>
